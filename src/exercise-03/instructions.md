# Exercise 03

## Setup

Make sure you run `npm run rest-server` in a terminal window,
since this exercise depends on it

## Description

The object is to plug TransactionDetails into a Redux store. To do this,
we will need to create a redux store, and then use the connect() method
from react-redux to plug into that store.

Go through the files in this order:

- redux/transactions-slice.js
- redux/create-store.js
- TransactionDetails.jsx
- PayorPayee.jsx
- TransactionDetails.jsx (return to it)
- Exercise3Manager.jsx
